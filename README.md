> [!IMPORTANT] 
> - These repositories contain solutions to TPs from my six years at ESI-SBA. While most solutions are my own, many friends and other students have contributed. I deeply appreciate their efforts and input.
> - Always read the solution and description files carefully. Try to solve the TP yourself first or, at the very least, understand what you've downloaded before using it.
> - These repositories focus solely on TPs. TDs and other resources are stored separately on a Google Drive linked on my GitHub user overview page.
> - If you‚Äôd like to contribute your solutions or improve the existing ones, fork the concerned repo and message me on my socials. I‚Äôll gladly add you as a contributor and merge your changes.
> - Attribution has been given to as many contributors as possible. If your solution was used but you weren‚Äôt credited, please contact me to fix this.



> [!NOTE]
> - Some solutions may no longer align with current TPs due to module updates or changes in technology.
> - Technologies used are listed in the repositories, but step-by-step execution guidance isn‚Äôt provided. A bit of research should help you figure it out.
> - Files are organized to the best of my ability. However, misplaced or miscategorized files may exist‚Äîplease flag any issues, and I‚Äôll resolve them.
> - Solutions might not match the corresponding description files or repositories in some cases. If you notice this, let me know.



> [!TIP]
> - These repositories are great references, but solving the TPs yourself first ensures deeper understanding and learning.
> - Unsure how to execute or run a solution? A quick search or review of the listed technologies should help.
> - Feel free to reach out to me with any inquiries, feedback, or questions‚ÄîI‚Äôm happy to assist!
> - Enjoy the learning process and make the most of these resources

> [!WARNING]  
> - Some solutions may be incorrect or incomplete. Use them as references, not definitive answers.
> - A few solutions are teacher-provided. Exercise caution, especially during consultations or review sessions, as these repositories are public and accessible to everyone.
> - Outdated solutions or inconsistencies may arise due to changes in modules, technologies, or assignment requirements.



> [!CAUTION]
> - Files are organized carefully, but some TPs or their associated files might be misplaced or incorrect. Double-check before using them.
> - Solutions from older drives or shared sources may have been used. If your work is included without proper credit, please contact me to resolve the issue.
> - While these repositories aim to be helpful, always verify the correctness and relevance of the solutions for your needs.
